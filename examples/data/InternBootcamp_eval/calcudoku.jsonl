As in a difference group, which of the cells contains the number to be divided is not specified.\n5.Numbers may be repeated within a group (so long as they're not also repeated within a row or column).  \n6.Puzzles are parsed in a \"puzzle spec\" format, where rows are given one per line, with cells separated by spaces. Groups are labelled with alphabetic characters, which are then used to identify cell membership. \n\n### Question\n\nNow the \"puzzle spec\" of a Calcudoko is: \n['J+5 I*8 M+7 M D*216 D', 'I I I B+11 B D', 'C/3 C A-2 O*20 P+2 D', 'K+8 K A O G/1 L+1', 'N/2 E+15 E F+8 G G', 'N E F F F H+5'] \n\nThe answer needs to provide the corresponding numbers for all positions in the Calcudoko.\n\nThe output should be given in order from left to right, top to bottom, with each element separated by a space and different lines separated by a comma.\nEnsure that your final answer is wrapped in double square brackets,like this: [[1 3 2,2 1 3,3 2 1]].
