The column clues are: [4, 4, 1, 3, 3, 4].\n\nYour task is to determine the water level for each aquarium. The water level is the highest row number filled (0-based from the bottom). Each aquarium's water level must be such that all its columns are filled up to this level.\n\nProvide your answer as a list of integers in column order (from left to right), where each integer is the water level for the corresponding column's aquarium.
